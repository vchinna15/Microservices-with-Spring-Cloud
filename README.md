# Microservices-with-Spring Boot

Evolution of Microservice Architecture style:
Monolithic Architecture-> Distributed Architecture -> Service Oriented Architecture -> Microservice Architecture & API

Microservice exposes Servie Endpoints as APIs. Service Endpoints are defined as REST/JSON over HTTP.

Microservice Architecture:
REST Architecture Principles
IPC(Inter Process Communication)
Transaction Management



Spring Boot can be used as a framework for HTTP/REST implementation to develop RESTFul Microservices.
