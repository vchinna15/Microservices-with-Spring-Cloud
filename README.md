# Microservices-with-Spring Boot
Microservice is a small(doing one thing/delivering single business capability), autonomous(deployed as single unit as technology-agnostic APIs) service. Communication between microservices are via network calls(which creates a distributed system and all the problems of distributed system like network failure, distributed transaction etc.).

Evolution of Microservice Architecture style:
Monolithic Architecture-> Distributed Architecture -> Service Oriented Architecture(coarse-grained service) -> Microservice Architecture(fine-grained service) & API

Microservice exposes Servie Endpoints as APIs. Service Endpoints are defined as REST/JSON over HTTP.

Microservice Architecture:
REST Architecture Principles
IPC(Inter Process Communication)
Transaction Management

Microservice Design(Loosely Coupled and Highly Cohesive):
howto model the microservice
howto integrate the microservices

Microservice Development:

Microservice Testing:
Unit Tests - Service tests - UI(End-to--End0 Tests

Microservicr Deployment:

Microservice Monitoring:

Microservice Security:

Microservice at scale(Scalable architecture):
Fault tolerant, highly available, high performing(fast response time), highly scalable

Scalable Architecture design principles:
Simplicity
Decomposition
Asynchronous
Loose Coupling High Cohesion
Concurrency and Parellization
Decentralization/Distribution
Stateless


Scalable Architecture Design Patterns:


Scalable Architecture Building Blocks(tools and frameworks):
Load Balancers
Messaging Queues
Caches
Reverse Proxy

REST (REpresentational State Transfer) API:
REST is an architectural style for Distributed hypermedia systems.

Archotectural principles(constraints) of REST:
Client-Server
Staeless
Caheable
Uniform Interface


Spring Boot can be used as a framework for HTTP/REST implementation to develop RESTFul Microservices.
Spring CLoud provides implementation for common distributed design patterns.
